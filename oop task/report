1.1 :

the deffrence between the shallow copy and deep copy:
Shallow Copy:
1- it creats a new copy of the original for example (array or list) but it dosent creat a separate copy 
of the elements nested within it.
2- if you modify somthing within an overlapping element the modification will apear in the original version.

Deep copy:
1= it creats a new copy of the object and duplicate the internal elements as well
2- any modification of the verision will not affect  the original

1.2:

multiple Inheritance:
definition:
multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class

what happens if the child and parent have the same method?
the childs method overrides the parents method

what happens if two parents have the same parent?
Python will use the Method Resolution Order "MRO" to determine which method to call avoiding duplicate calls to the shared parent
